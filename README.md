#blockup

With Blockup you can insert ContentBlocks images using [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com). You'll need to create an Uploadcare account and obtain an API Key, Then set your `blockup.uploadcare_pub_key` System Setting to your new API key.

## Getting Started
First you'll need to get your public API key. You can get that by creating an [Uploadcare account](https://uploadcare.com/accounts/create/plan-based/28/). You can use demo public key during dev stage, but note that demo account files are removed every few hours.

Each time you create a ContentBlocks field of the blockup type you can configure which tabs displays as well as the cropping settings.
